Date : Wed 26/10/95. Alterations file since Sat 22/10/95.Scott,   This is a list of the libraries & files I have changed & the reasons why.This should (hopefully) be a completely, utterly, absolutely bug freeversion. It would probably be best that you do a full build when these newlibraries are put in place just to make sure everything's in place & O.K.         -----------------------------------------------------------------------------Contents :-----------------------------------------------------------------------------Text File :   'README'  - (This File)Text File :   'SIZES'   - (List of all files in directory + sizes for check)                          This also has the size of the executable so you                          can check it against yours when built.DIRECTORY 1 : 'NEWLIBS' - Contains - Star3000.c new main file                                   - Altered library files (in SFLib) to                                     overwrite old ones.DIRECTORY 2 : 'REMOTES' - New files to overwrite old ones in                          'Remote:SF_Resources'. I'll include the directory                          Structure as well.DIRECTORY 3 : 'MISC'    - Additional files you need. Banner Screen File &                          cd-rom.tcl. NOTE : The cd-rom.tcl has not had the                          'Preinitialise' flag set yet (this presumably needs                          to be done), also, no optimization has been tried.Note for Sizes file. Only the .s, .c and .h source files need to be verified.To check on yours, set the current directory in MPW and type'files -x tckrbm' This should bring up a list similar to the one in the file.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------Libraries / Main Code Altered :-----------------------------------------------------------------------------Star3000.c      - MAIN FILE                  (1) Main game loop always executes game update for first                  frame. Previously if the player started a mission & held                  'Stop' (Menu) straight away, the 1st frame of the game was                  not updated properly.                  (2) Hiscore was sometimes being entered into wrong place in                  hiscore table.SF_Access.c     - Took out #'s in filename loads for CD-Rom. I'd originally                  appended a '#' to the RAW image files just so I could tell                  the difference between normal 3DO image files & the raw                  screen data ones (which I put in to get around the memory/                  backdrop problem). Filenames with a '#' are however not                  acceptable when loading from CD-Rom, although it doesn't                  tell you - Cause of much of a panic last Saturday morning !                  This library no longer expects the raw files to have a #                  on the end.                - Please rename & remove #'s from files in SF_Remote:ImagesSF_Message.c    - (1) Now gives extra life every 250,000 points                                 (2) Score now always visibleSF_Control.c    - (1) Does not crash when docked in mothership & mothership                      explodes.                  (2) Formation mode always starts in NORMAL on mission startSF_NVRam.c      - Check for not enough memory now works O.K. It used to save                  an empty file as well as displaying the message. Now fixed.SF_Map.c        - Fixed problem with ground / tracking lock.SF_Menu.c       - Fixed to stop no. of weapons temporarily disappearing when                  user goes from pause menu back into the game.SF_ARMBurn.s    - Fixed some sea-by-land turning into land when burntSmoke_Control.c - Altered To help speed up the explosionsSmoke_Plot.s    - Altered to help speed up the explosionsSetup_Tables.c  - Altered To adjust the sam fire rate. See start of                  Setup_Tables.h for the 2 defines that change the fire rate                  for ground lasers and sams, These settings now seem to be                  about right.Setup_Tables.h  - As above.                - To change SAM frequency, alter #define SAM_FIRE_RATE                - To change LASER frequency, alter #define LASER_FIRE_RATEShip_Control.c  - Fixed to get correct E.C.M count displayCollision_Update.c - To stop the player getting shot inside the mothership-----------------------------------------------------------------------------Remote Files Altered In SF_Resources :-----------------------------------------------------------------------------Text/English/Credits - Put in testers namesImages/<allwith#>    - These have not been included. Could you rename all                       the image files ending with a '#' to remove the '#'.                       Ie. 'Images:Menu5#' becomes 'Images:Menu5'Graphics/Space       - File has been improvedMissions/T/MISS_14                - Changed mission file TRAINING-14 to ICE                                    planetMissions/Maps/BASIC/E18E18/S_MAP  - As Above (Adjusted map for mission T-14)Cels/Game.Ice                     - New ICE map backdrop included (does not                                    show holes in it)
