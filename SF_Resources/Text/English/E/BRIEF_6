Traitor !Darkworld02/03/3038We have uncovered enemy attempts toinfiltrate our organization.Our scanners reported a ship leavingthe academy about an hour ago. It wastracked by spy satellites to theenemy's main command center. Whoeverthe mole is, he's meeting with enemymilitary leaders in one of the center'smain military towers.We have no time for furtherinvestigation. All the main towersmust be destroyed.You have already been picked up onradar by a light patrol formation.Expect resistence.Return to the Mothership to completeyour mission.- MOTHERSHIP -Jake Phillips#
