Sea BreezeEarth11/27/3037We have received news that part of anactive fleet of aircraft carriersare being refurbished at the enemy base.These carriers are normally heavilydefended, carrying as many as 16attack fighters each. During servicinghowever, we know that only a skeletonforce is kept aboard.This is an ideal time to strike at theiraerial capability.You have two main target areas:1) Destroy the carriers quickly toprevent them from scrambling to theirdefense craft.2) Head south-east to the runway.Destroy the hangar and both controltowers.#
