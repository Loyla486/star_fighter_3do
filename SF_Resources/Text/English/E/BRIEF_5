Command and ControlEarth11/02/3037Thanks to some great undercover work,we managed to jam one of the enemybase's entire local radar networkwhile they were engaged in large scalemilitary excercises.A large number of FedNet fighterpersonnel were moved into attack.Enemy losses were huge and all of theirshort range fighters in the area weredestroyed. A residual combat force isnow patrolling the area, awaitingfurther instructions.However, a number of large scaleaerial targets still exist and we needyou to take command of the "mop up"operation. You have been given a fastcommand ship with which you can directyour crew.Warning! Avoid combat in this vessel.It is not built to take the stressof enemy fire.Command your vessel wisely.Re-dock with Mothership to completemission.#
