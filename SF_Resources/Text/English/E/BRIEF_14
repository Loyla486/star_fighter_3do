Enemy Arms Meeting
Earth
01/17/3038

The forces of evil are holding an arms
meeting on the space stations above
the planet's surface.

A heavily guarded transporter is
leaving this island on a direct flight
path to the space stations. It must not
arrive.

Once you have taken out the
transporter, return to the Mothership
to complete your mission.
