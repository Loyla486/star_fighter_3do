Blanket Bombing
Chemica
10/03/3037

We have an oportunity to inflict some
damage on the enemy.

The explosives refinery currently has
40 incendiary devices in storage.

Destroy both warehouses to collect
the stock and proceed toward the target
area.

We need to destroy the processing
centers used for making these high
grade explosives.

Fly in low and fast over both target
areas and scatter the contents. Both
targets will require a double pass.

Additional : Two enemy cargo vessels
have been spotted directly ahead.
Both must be eliminated.

Return to the Mothership to complete
your mission.
