Chemical Weapons Test
Chemica
08/03/3038

The enemy is in the process of testing
his new range of freefall bombs --
codename "white heat."

These weapons could inflict serious
damage to the FedNet force. We've been
ordered to put a stop to the testing.

Destroy the chemical processing center
as well as the monitoring and control site.

When ground targets have been
eliminated, destroy the enemy test
fighter.

Return to the Mothership to complete
your mission.
