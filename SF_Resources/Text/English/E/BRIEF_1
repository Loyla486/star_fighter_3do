Scanners DownEarth07/02/3037While on patrol over enemy territoryyou found a lone enemy fighter,apparently unarmed.Now that you've persued it back toenemy airspace, you discover you'vebeen led into an enemy trap.You are up against 10 short rangetactical fighters and your scannersare being jammed by a high frequencycontrol tower somewhere on thesurface.Destroy the tower and eliminate all 10fighters to complete your mission.Just before your scanners went downthere was a power surge at gridreference (B, 5).#
