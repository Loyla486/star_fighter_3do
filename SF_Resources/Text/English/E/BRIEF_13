Remote Mining Station
Chemica
04/14/3038

Your superiors have decided to take
out the enemy's mineral and fuel
mining facilities. The minerals mined
will eventually be converted into enemy
airframes and rocket fuel.

Destroying this plant will stem the
flow of raw materials to the enemy's
factories.

The plant is very lightly armed and
can be easily destroyed. However, 3
heavily armed enemy cargo vessels are
approaching the plant. Do NOT engage
them in battle - you do not have the
support.

You will have approximately 2 minutes
before the cargo vessels are in range.

When the target is destroyed, return
as quickly as possible to the Mothership
and leave the area.

DELAY WILL BE FATAL
