The enemy has started speculating for
mineral ore in the area and has
established five excavation sites. If
their search is successful thay will start
developing the area and convert the ore
into weapons for the war effort.

Your mission is to destroy all five
sites immediately.

To complete your mission destroy all
targets marked on the map and return
to the Mothership.
