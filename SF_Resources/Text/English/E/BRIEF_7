BrainwashedAres02/16/3037Several of our top scientists havebeen kidnapped by the enemy and arebeing put to work to produce a weaponof incredible power.We have a rough idea of where they arelocated in the research complex.However, we have also learned thatthey have been irreversiblybrainwashed, so this mission will notinvolve extraction.It has been decided that they must beexterminated as soon as possible.Return to the Mothership to completeyour mission.- MOTHERSHIP -Callum Blaze#
