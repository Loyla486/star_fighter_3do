Enemy Attack Platform
Earth
05/21/3038

FedNet spies have informed your
superiors about 2 new enemy
spacestations that are under
construction.

However, your superiors have known
about this development for some time.

The enemy are building an attack
platform hidden in the asteroid belt
of the Milky Way.

One of the spacestations is already
operational and heavily defended. The
other station is completely open.

Destroy both.

Intelligence reports indicate they both
hold a number of short range fighters.

We have teleported allied pilots into
2 of the enemy fighters. These are
currently trailing the Mothership in
formation.
