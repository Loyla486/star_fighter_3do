Rookie Pilots

10/12/3037

Disobeying orders, 2 trainee pilots
under your command and supervision
have left the Academy and flown an
unauthorized sortie into enemy
airspace.

They have been intercepted by 6 enemy
tactical fighters and are outgunned
and outclassed.

Their safety is your responsibility.
Eliminate the attack craft and return
the pilots safely to the Mothership.
