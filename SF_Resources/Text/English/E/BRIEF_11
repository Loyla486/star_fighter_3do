Remote Fuel DepotEarth04/05/3038We have located a remote enemy basewhich is probably a reprocessing plantfor a planned naval attack force.The base is lightly defended, but thereare some enemy ships and nuclearsubmarines (known to be armed withhigh power lasers) in the area.The small runway hangar holds 1 shortrange attack craft.This is the 'LMII Cobra',a very fast ship with upgraded laserand missile capabilities.Leave the Mothership and destroy allenemy vessels, procesing facilities,and oil rigs.Redock with the Mothership tocomplete your mission.#
