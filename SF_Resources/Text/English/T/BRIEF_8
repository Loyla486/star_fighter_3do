The Space StationEarth11/18/3037The pre-flight briefing suggested onlylight resistence. You were to attack alightly defended enemy space stationin the stratosphere, and they alsoprovided you with aerial support.What you are about to find out however,is that 6 hours ago, the station wasre-armed with 6 tactical fighters.You must now take these fighters out.Redock with Mothership for transportback to the base.- MOTHERSHIP -Stefan Lancaster- AERIAL SUPPORT-Kelly ForesterLeslie Jacobs#
