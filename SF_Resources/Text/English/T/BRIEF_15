Transmission TowersEarth10/05/3037The Darkworld's intelligencetransmission towers are the backbone forall Darkworld military information.FedNet satellites have been interceptingand decoding these messages for over 6months.The satellites, however, were recentlydiscovered and eliminated. You havebeen sent in with a mothership to destroyboth towers.The enemy have picked you up on radarand have sent in two high speed fightersto intercept the Mothership.Destroy these fighters, protectthe Mothership, and eliminate bothground targets.Additional : With one of the towersdestroyed, a fast buildup of energywill take place. You will haveapproximately 30 seconds before theresulting power surge knocks out all ofyour ship's control functions.- MOTHERSHIP -Luke Forester#
