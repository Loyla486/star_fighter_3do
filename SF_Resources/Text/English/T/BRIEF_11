Chemical DeliveryChemica02/03/3038The enemy is expecting a new deliveryof materials -- ready for processinginto high grade weapons.Preventing this delivery will haltproduction for at least a month.Reports indicate the chemical tankeris too heavily defended to destroy.Your target instead is the runway complexat grid reference (A,2). Destroy thisand force the tanker to turn back.The complex is only lightly defendedwith laser fire and 2 short rangefighters.Return to Mothership to complete yourmission.- MOTHERSHIP -Luke Forester#
