Sneak Attack
Ares
21/11/3037

Intelligence has been reporting for
some time about a growing rift between
enemy military leaders and their chief
strategists.

High above the wastelands in enemy
territory, a large battle is taking
place between the strategists'
fighters.

This seems to be an ideal opportunity
to sneak in and eliminate their long
range radar systems. Due to a weakness
in the design, a direct hit on the
control building will cause an explosive
chain reaction, destroying all radar
installations.

Warning! It will not take long for
both sides to realize that a real
enemy is in their midst.

Your attack must be swift and
deadly.

Redock with Mothership to finish
mission.
