Rocket Pad
Darkworld
01/03/3038

The enemy has a new weapon .....

Our satellites have been reporting
construction activity on the Darkworld
for some time.

We now have a clear picture of what
they've been building.

16 skystar rockets have been spotted
on a launch pad to the east. Destroy
the entire pad and return to the
Mothership.

You have already been picked up on
radar by a light patrol formation.

Analysis of their flight path suggests
they are going in for the Mothership.
