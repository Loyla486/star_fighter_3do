The enemy has been investing in some
new equipment. Wealthy from
over taxing his constituents, one of the
enemy's legislators has built a new
complex dedicated to the production of
his new weapon - a high speed, long
range laser cannon.

We cannot allow production of this
weapon to go ahead. An attack now
would cause maximum disruption.

Destroy all production facilities and
return to the Mothership.

The complex is extremely well
defended, shielded by the mountains
to the north and south.
