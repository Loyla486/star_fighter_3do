Strategic Bomber Test
Earth
05/31/3038

You have been selected for a military
test flight of the new super fast
bomber.

This bomber has been billed by FedDef
Industries as their easy solution to the
universal takeover problem and has a
lot of money riding on its successful
trials.

Our government will be very displeased
if the trials don't go well. The entire
complex is on red alert. Select your
super weapon and destroy all
specified targets in the 4 areas.

As an incentive, FedNet has hidden
several bonuses throughout the
designated targets.

Your ship has been stripped to bare
minimum to increase payload
- you do not have the option of taking
enemy fire for long.

You have been granted 4 minutes to
complete the mission and redock with the
Mothership.
