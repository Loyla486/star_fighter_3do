Launch SiteDarkworld05/03/3038The enemy is known to be reinforcingtheir defenses. The main bulk oftheir defensive capability stems from 7scramble hangars capable of launchingfast attack craft at enormous speed.In order to run further attacksagainst the enemy, we need to knockout this defense. Destroy all the hangars,control towers, and radar satellites.Warning! Attack craft are known to bevery fast - do not engage unlessabsolutely necessary!- MOTHERSHIP -Leslie Jacobs#
