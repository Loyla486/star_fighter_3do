Bomber Training
Earth
09/01/3038

You are supervising two trainee pilots
in advanced combat bombing
practice.

Under the safe guidance of their
teacher, they fly off to attack their
assigned targets.

You are there to mop-up any missed
targets and to ensure their safety.

One problem. Reports of clear airspace
were incorrect; 5 enemy fighters
are closing in fast.
You must destroy them to ensure the
safety of your pupils and the Mothership.
