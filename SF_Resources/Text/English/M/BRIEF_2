Tractor Beam Matrix

"Gency...Emergency...This is flight
captain Leslie Jacobs. My crew and I
are locked into some kind of tractor
beam.

It's pulling us into the asteroid
belt..."

Out on a reconnaissance mission, all 6
team members are being dragged into
the enemy asteroid stronghold.

You have one of our fastest fighters,
equipped with a short-range tractor
unit. A close flyby with each crew
member will engage the retrieval
unit, and bring your team mates back
into formation.

Once they are all safe, destroy the
satellites and return to the
Mothership.
