Trial and Error

The research and development people
want to try out a new shield-generating
system.

"The best research," they say, "comes
from actual-in-the-field-action"
meaning that they want to beam you and
a full complement of attack craft into an
enemy zone that they know has at least 20
enemy fighters flying around.

Survival means we're onto a winner.

Mission completed after you have
destroyed the enemy fighters.
