Lost in SpaceDeep Space01/22/3038After single handedly destroying over200 fighters and 27 battle cruisersyou find yourself in Deep Space.That little collision with an asteroidafter your battle crashed your radar.There are still some fighters in the area.You must return to the Mothership anddock for repairs before they find you.The Mothership's last recordedposition was somewhere beneath theasteroid belt.- MOTHERSHIP -Stefan Lancaster#
