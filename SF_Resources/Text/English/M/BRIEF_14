Taken Over
Earth
06/24/3038

The academy training center has been
taken over by the enemy, who is
currently making lists of demands
while keeping our new cadets hostage.

However, FedNet doesn't respond well
to terrorist demands. Consequently,
you are required to destroy all of the
occupied buildings marked on the map
to allow the cadets to escape from their
subterranean cells.

Return to the Mothership to complete your
mission.
