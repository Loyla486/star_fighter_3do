Enemy Gathering
Earth
06/13/3038

Something's up. A large meeting is
taking place on a remote island among
all of the enemy leaders.

Three class-A transport ships are
carrying all the warrior leaders,
military officials, and servants of
the enemy leader toward a small
airstrip on the island.

Each transport is heavily armed and
has 2 upgraded fighters flying in a
defensive formation.

Ground defenses have also been
improved as an added security measure.
Your mission is to destroy all 3
transports before they touch the
ground.

Then destroy all headquarter buildings
and redock with the Mothership.

This wil not be an easy mission. Good
Luck.
