Surrounded
Ares
01/17/3038

While refitting the Mothership's warp
drive engines in orbit around an
enemy's planet, a wing of patrol craft
surprised us and surrounded our
ship.

The only people aboard are you and
Jane Holly-Dean. Jane will have to
stay aboard and pilot the Mothership
so it is up to you to destroy the enemy
fighters and protect the Mothership.
