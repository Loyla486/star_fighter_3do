Trouble BrewingMars07/03/3038Returning from a stealth attack on theenemy's asteroid belt, radio and radarcontact is resumed.But what comes up on the scanners is notgood. At current trajectory and speed theFedNet Mothership is on a course for adirect fly by 2 enemy stratoliners, eachaccompanied by a formation offighters.Luckily, neither craft has spotted youyet, so you still have the elementof surprise.- MOTHERSHIP -Spyder- AERIAL SUPPORT -Dave ValiantLeslie JacobsJohn T.
