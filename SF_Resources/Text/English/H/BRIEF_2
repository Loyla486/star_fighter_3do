The enemy have just completed their
latest addition to their array of
biochemical weapons. 

- an incredibly lethal gas which
genetically targets humans and leaves
all other organic life unaffected.

The head of division is arriving to
inspect the new plant under very heavy
scrutiny. The mothership and three
wingmen have just intercepted the
craft. It must be prevented from
landing.

Destroy the landing site as well as
all weapons and machinery in the
valley.

Expect fire from ground lasers, enemy
patrols, satellites, and A-T-A
launches.

Return to the Mothership to complete
your mission.
