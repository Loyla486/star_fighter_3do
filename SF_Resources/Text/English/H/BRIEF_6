Broadcast Towers
Earth
10/05/3038

The enemy's intelligence satellite
towers have been rebuilt, rearmed, and
improved.

These new LK II satellite towers are
now in operation.

We have learned that this is now a
joint operation amongst the enemy and
all their allies throughout the galaxy
which allows them to rout the received
information to all their armies.

The towers are heavily armed
- they have learned from past mistakes.

The enemy have picked you up on radar
and have sent in 6 high speed fighters
to intercept and destroy the Mothership.

Destroy these fighters, protect the
Mothership, and eliminate all
broadcast towers.

Additional: The towers must be
destroyed in pairs with fewer than 20
seconds between each hit to prevent a power
surge that would knock out your ship.
