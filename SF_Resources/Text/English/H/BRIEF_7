ConglomerationEarth10/01/3038Enemy operations are merging together,making their bases more efficientand easier to defend.Our Intelligence operatives haveintercepted a copy of the enemies'plan, 'Conglomeration'.They plan to turn the dark Lord's earthmilitary site into an impregnablefortress by centralizing much of itsattack force.This would allow the Dark forcessustained control over a significantairspace, while making future attackson the site extremely difficult.This operation is already underway, soan immediate strike is needed if weare to succeed. Eliminate as many groundtargets as possible and destroy all ofthe aerial defenses.Return to the Mothership to complete yourmission.- MOTHERSHIP -Callum Blaze- AERIAL SUPPORT-SpyderJohn T.
