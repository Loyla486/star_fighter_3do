Nerve GasEarth11/31/3038The radar screens at the trainingacademy have suddenly startedflashing.Simultaneously de-cloaking, over 25enemy satellites spread all over theacademy at high altitude are countingdown to release deadly poison.Thousands of personnel will die if onlyone of these canisters explodes.Fortunately, you and your crew wereout on manoeuvers field testingprototype fighters when the satellitesrevealed themselves.You have under 4 minutes to destroyevery satellite on the map. Failure todo so will result in a sudden and painfuldeath.Spyder, Kelly, and Hazel are doingwhat they can, but you are in thefastest ship - the responsibility isyours.#
