Our satellites indicate thatthe enemy has produced 4 of the Series2000 which are patrolling the frozenmountains of Pluto.There is also a well defendedproduction unit hidden amongst themountains in this area.All 4 of the fighters must bedestroyed along with the productionunits.Intelligence reports indicate thatthat the factory is well defended by aheavy concentration of SAM bases andaircraft.#
