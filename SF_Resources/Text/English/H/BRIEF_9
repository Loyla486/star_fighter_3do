RiggedEarth09/27/3038The mission that started as a simpleoperation to destroy some oil rigshas become slightly tricky. Scannersindicate 8 fighter craft are headingtoward the Mothership with the intentof stopping us in our tracks.It is vital that you hold back fromyour main mission of destroying theoil rigs and, instead, defend theMothership.- Once the Mothership is secure, goto the planet's surface and destroy the oilrigs marked on the map.Redock in the Mothership to completeyour mission.- MOTHERSHIP -Crusher#
