Military Central
Earth
09/20/3038

This is the heartland of Xeugar, an
evil and powerful space pirate who has
sided with the enemy and is supplying them
with heavily armed fighters.

4 FedNet fighters accidentally strayed
into his territory and were destroyed.

Xeugar considers the FedNet presence
to be a declaration of war.

These 3 space stations are the nerve
center of Xeugar's military activities
in space. It has always been regarded
as too dangerous for attack;
until now...

The strain of the war effort is
beginning to show and the forces of
evil have nearly depleted the pirates's
stock of bomber-pilots and ships. If we
destroy his operation, we will severely
cripple the enemy's supply of fighters
and pilots.

Destroy the 3 space stations along
with all defense and communications
satellites.

Caution! Intelligence reports enemy
cargo vessels and short range fighters
in the vicinity.
