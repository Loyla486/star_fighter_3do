Enemy FleetEarth07/13/3038Satellites have picked up a slowmoving enemy fleet to the north of theenemy refining island.You're going in.The aircraft carriers are known to becarrying nearly 15% of the enemy'stactical fighters. This is an ideal timeto strike ....Enemy fighters have already beenalerted to your presence andscrambled. Expect more once youengage.Additional: Destroy A-T-A ground boatsfirst to reduce enemy missile launch.- MOTHERSHIP -Stefan Lancaster#
