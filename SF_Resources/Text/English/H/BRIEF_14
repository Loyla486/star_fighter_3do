Enemy Cruiser FleetEarth09/16/3038The enemy has assembled a new andformidable attack fleet that is nowready to attack. It must be destroyedat all costs.Eliminating this fleet will make avery large dent in the enemy's attackforce. You are in command of this operationas well as the 7 wingmen sent to assistyou.Approximately 10 starcruisers arebeing prepared for a bombing raid onthe academy. The fleet of enemy cruisersare protected by attack satellites, aplasma shield generator, and other enemypatrols.All must be destroyed. Also destroythe bomb storage depot and all grounddefenses.- ATTACK FORCE -Jake PhillipsCrusherHazel PhoenixLuke ForesterCallum BlazeLeslie JacobsJane Holly-Dean#
