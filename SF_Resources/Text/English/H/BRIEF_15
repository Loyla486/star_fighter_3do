Darkworld Meeting
Darkworld
06/04/3037

FedNet peace talks with the enemy went
drastically wrong.

The enemy responded by launching an
attack with 2 of their most powerful
battle cruisers.

Since this was an originally peaceful
mission, you are the only fighter on
board and it is now up to you to save the
day.

Destroy the 2 cruisers and return
to the Mothership once your task is
complete.
