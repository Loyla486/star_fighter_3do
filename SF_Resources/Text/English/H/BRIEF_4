Follow the LeaderDarkworld12/07.3038We are going after the Darkworld'smain power facility. Advance fighterpilots have already cleared most of theaerial defenses.You have 2 specific targets:1) The remaining droid craft.The control beacons have already beendestroyed, leaving a crocodile formationof enemy fighters on a fixed flightpathover the reactor core. All must bedestroyed.2) The generator.This is still heavily defended withA-T-A launchers and laser cannons.It must be destroyed along with thepower distributor towers surrounding it.- MOTHERSHIP -Leslie Jacobs#
